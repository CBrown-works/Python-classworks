    "This assignment will only be using [Partition 1](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EBCFKM/BMXYCB). Recall that in Homework 1 we started to construct the analytics base table for our [SWAN-SF Dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EBCFKM). In that assignment, we read the data from the two subdirectories, __FL__ and __NF__, of the __partition1__ direcotry. These two subdirectories represented the two classes of our target feature in the solar flare prediction problem we will be attempting to solve this semester. We then processed these samples of multivariate time series to construct descriptive features for each sample, and then placed them into our analytics base table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be utilizing a set of extracted descriptive features much like what you were asked to construct in Homework 1. However, this dataset contains many more extracted features than you were asked to compute for Homework 1 (>800), so we need to explore the data to find data quality issues and identify ways to address these issues. Below are links to the full extracted feature dataset for partition 1 and a toy dataset to use for testing you functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ Since the full dataset, and multiple copies of partially processed intermediary results, tend to take up a bit of space, you can use the toy dataset to implement and test your code. You may need to edit the data to fully test each of the requirements, but that is left as an exercise for the student. The full partition dataset is only included for those who wish to work with it once they have their code implemented. \n",

    "- [Toy Partition 1 feature dataset](http://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/solar/data/toy_partition1ExtractedFeatures.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the extracted features csv files, you will load that data into a Pandas DataFrame using the [pandas.read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) method.  \n"
