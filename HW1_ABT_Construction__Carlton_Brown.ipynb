    "Now that you have the tools to read the data and process descriptive features, it is time to put this all together to produce an analytics base table for all of the data in Partiton 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you shall construct a method that will process a partition by extracting features for each sample in both the __FL__ and __NF__ subdirectories of that partition. The extracted descriptive features (e.g., `TOTPOT_MEDIAN`) are to be placed into your analytics base table DataFrame as colums, with the addition of the `FLARE_TYPE` target feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* Your method should take in the partition location and assume that there will be __FL__ and __NF__ subdirectories to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember that your analytics base table should contain 5 flare types (`X`, `M`, `C`, `B`, and `FQ`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your method shall also take in the name of the analytics base table to store. This should be the full name with either an absolute or relative path to store the table also part of the passed in name. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Suggestion__: It would be a good idea to debug your function on a much smaller version of one partition (often claled a \"pet dataset\") and run it on the entire Partition 1 only when you are confident that it is error-free.\n",

    "Below you will find a method defintion, complete it to perform the above specified information. You can use a method call in another code block to test that your method works as required.\n"

The x-axis of the plot should represent the flare types and the y-axis should represent the counts of samples."
